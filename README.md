### Hey. I'm UHDbits.
### I'm a small YouTuber (around 120 subscribers) and I also code every now and then.

### Currently, I'm working on coming back to YouTube after a long break. Due to this, I won't be developing much in the next couple of months. I may do some, but not a lot.

### When I feel comfortable, I'll start coding again, and my current projects will be below this. Thanks for reading!
